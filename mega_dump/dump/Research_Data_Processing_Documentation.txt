OVERVIEW
========
This document traces the complete data processing flow from original research paper extraction 
to final cleaned research content suitable for further analysis and processing.

ORIGINAL DATA SOURCE
===================
- Source: Research paper DOI links from biomedical literature
- Initial Input: data.csv containing DOI links to research papers
- Domain: Biomedical and microbiome research papers

PROJECT STRUCTURE
=================
proj_2/     - Research content extraction and cleaning
archive/    - Development scripts and intermediate processing files

COMPLETE DATA PROCESSING FLOW
=============================

PHASE 1: RESEARCH CONTENT EXTRACTION (proj_2/)
==============================================

1. DOI EXTRACTION & ARTICLE SCRAPING
   - Source: data.csv (contains DOI links to research papers)
   - Process: Web scraping of full-text research articles
   - Challenge: Many URLs failed (documented in failed_urls.txt)
   - Initial Output: Raw extracted text content

2. INITIAL DATA COMPILATION
   - Output: final_extraction.json (raw extracted research content)
   - Size: ~203MB of unprocessed text chunks
   - Content: 2,032 documents with 478,326 text chunks
   - Issues: Malformed JSON, duplicate content, metadata artifacts

PHASE 2: DATA CLEANING & VALIDATION (archive/)
==============================================

3. JSON STRUCTURE REPAIR
   - Script: robust_json_cleaner.py
   - Problem: Original JSON file had formatting issues (line 498650 error)
   - Solution: Line-by-line parsing to reconstruct valid JSON
   - Process: Handle malformed JSON, escape sequences, nested structures

4. TEXT CHUNK CLEANING
   - Script: clean_json_data.py
   - Process: Remove academic paper artifacts, metadata, copyright notices
   - Removed: PMC IDs, DOIs, author affiliations, navigation elements
   - Deduplication: Remove repeated text chunks
   - Output: cleaned_data.json

5. ADVANCED CLEANING PIPELINE
   - Script: text_processor.py (BiomedicalTextProcessor class)
   - Features:
     * Biomedical abbreviation expansion (DNA, RNA, PCR, etc.)
     * Scientific stop word removal
     * Entity pattern recognition (species, diseases, chemicals)
     * Sentence segmentation for NLP processing
   - Output: Processed text ready for NER analysis

6. SCIENTIFIC CONTENT VALIDATION
    - Script: final_validation.py
    - Purpose: Ensure no important research content was lost during cleaning
    - Validation: 99.4% scientific content retention rate confirmed
    - Method: Pattern matching for research terms, statistical indicators, scientific concepts

7. CONTENT INVESTIGATION & REFINEMENT
    - Script: investigate_lost_content.py
    - Process: Analyze "lost" chunks to verify they were non-essential
    - Categories: Research-diluting content, metadata, navigation elements
    - Outcome: Confirmed cleaning preserved all essential scientific content

PHASE 3: FINAL DATA PREPARATION & CLEANUP
=========================================

8. FINAL CLEANING & DEDUPLICATION
    - Process: Remove duplicate chunks across all documents
    - Deduplication: 201,590 duplicate chunks removed
    - Unique chunks preserved: 241,873
    - Categories removed:
      * publication_metadata: 24,160 chunks
      * copyright_license: 4,747 chunks
      * ui_navigation: 2,414 chunks
      * author_affiliation: 1,431 chunks
      * academic_boilerplate: 943 chunks

9. FILE CLEANUP & ORGANIZATION
    - Script: cleanup_files.py
    - Removed: 13 intermediate analysis files (2.6GB freed)
    - Preserved: Essential data files and processing logs
    - Final dataset: research_content_cleaned_20250824_222305.json (100.3MB)

FINAL DATA STATISTICS
====================
- Original documents: 2,032
- Final documents: 2,026 (99.7% retention)
- Original chunks: 478,326
- Final unique chunks: 241,873 (50.6% size reduction)
- Scientific content retention: 99.4%
- File size reduction: 203MB → 100MB (50.6% reduction)
