## 2026-09-01 — MAIN_DATA screen: contamination confirmed, but it is not what moved agreement

Full write-up: `FINDINGS_task1_maindata_filter.md`.

**Tested.** Whether screening the 45 title-matched MAIN_DATA papers to human
case-control studies recovers the ~4-point agreement drop with Disbiome/Peryton.

**Survived.** The contamination itself is real and large: reading all 45 full texts,
**22 of 45 (49%) are not human case-control studies** — 15 animal (3xTgAD, R6/1,
Wistar rats, germ-free recolonisation), 3 with no healthy control arm, 2 case
reports (n=1, n=2), 2 with no primary cohort (a review, a Mendelian-randomisation
re-analysis). Every verdict carries a verbatim quote in `maindata_screen.json`.

**Did NOT survive — the headline hypothesis is refuted.** Filtering them changed the
agreement rate by **exactly nothing**: 0 decisive pairs flipped, against either
database, in any variant (exact McNemar p = 1.00 throughout). Not an underpowered
null — a true zero. The 22 papers contribute only 11 of 1,927 edges and 4 of 285
contributing papers; 18 of the 22 yielded no usable extraction at all.

**Why the number ever moved: disease mix, not quality.** The naive per-variant
comparison is confounded — dropping papers drops whole diseases, moving Disbiome's
reference denominator 506 → 364, so variants score different question sets. Paired
per (taxid, disease), the movement is entirely pairs entering/leaving the decisive
set. Dropping all 45 removes 21 decisive pairs, **19 of them Autism spectrum
disorder**, on which we agree with Disbiome 10/21 (48%) versus 112/147 (76%) for
pairs that stay. 17 of the 21 rest on 1–2 papers.

**Null, with power.** ASD's low agreement (52.6%, n=19 pairs) does **not** survive
paper-level permutation: those 19 pairs come from only **5 papers**. Observed gap
−0.225, null SD 0.139, minimum detectable gap 0.273, **p = 0.211**. The test cannot
resolve a gap this size at 5 papers. Pair-level shuffling would have given a false
positive — same trap as the earlier `diet_controlled` (FDR 0.243) and
"198 explanatory terms" (p=0.41) artifacts.

**Applied anyway, on construct-validity grounds, not the metric.** `graph.json`,
`kg.html`, `docs/index.html` rebuilt on the screened corpus: **326 papers, 281
contributing, 832 taxa, 1,916 edges, 225 contested, 625 containment links.** A human
microbe–disease graph should not carry edges whose evidence is transgenic-vs-wildtype
mice. The filter costs nothing and buys correctness of meaning — **it does not improve
agreement and must not be cited as though it did.**

**Infrastructure.** This environment's network policy denies `ftp.ncbi.nih.gov`
(CONNECT → 403), so the NCBI taxdump is unavailable. `build_kg.py` previously fell
straight through to string folding when the taxdump was missing — a silent
regression costing 681 taxid resolutions and all 625 containment links while still
printing a successful build. Added `taxonomy_cache.py`, which replays the resolution
recorded in `graph.json`; verified it reproduces the committed graph **exactly**
(nodes, edges, hierarchy, paper table all identical on a full rebuild diff). It is
valid **only for subsets** of that graph and reports cache misses rather than
silently under-resolving. On the external join it is marginally degraded (Disbiome
overlap 269 vs 272; Peryton 221 vs 221), so absolute agreement rates measured here
are ~0.2–1.1 points off taxdump-measured ones and are not new absolute figures;
all before/after deltas use the identical join and are sound.

**Next lever.** ASD is the weakest region of the graph (new disease, 1–2 papers per
edge, chance-level agreement) and the question is now specific: is ASD genuinely
less replicable, or did 5 papers land badly? That needs more ASD papers, not more
analysis of these 5.
